ML notebook and code for the LLM bot
The llm bot is using langchain's GPT4ALL integration which runs an orca llm model , the small 3b parameter one which runs on the cpu and gives relatively fast responses.
It runs locally, I've set the prompt for it to act like a mental health therapist, if you want to try and run it you will have to change the directory to where you have the model saved, after that just run it in the terminal with the command "streamlit run app.py".
It should pop up a tab with the app rujnning on localhost.


The machine learning model uses patient information to predict their mental health status. It will be useful in classifying patients and help doctors in the process. The model used is Random forest regressor and the module used is sci kit learn along with matplotlib for visualization
